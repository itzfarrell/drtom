index.html - minimal lines of code, easy as pie to follow along with

canvas2mp4.js - the js portion -- remove the demo stuff obviously for use in your own stuff

vercel.json - header customizations if your server is throwing sharedbuffer errors (named vercel.json because i use vercel to deploy)

upload.php - process the file uploaded via the ajax in the .js file

uploads folder - init.placeholder file in it to make sure uploads folder gets created
